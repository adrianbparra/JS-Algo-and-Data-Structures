// basic approach solving a problem

// what an algotithm is
// a process or set if steps ti accomplish a certain task

// how do you improve
// 1. device a plan for solving problems
// 2. master common problem solving patterns


//### problem solving strategies

// -- Understand the problem
// 1. restate the problem in my own words
// 2. what are the inputs
// 3. whar are the outputs
// 4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs
// 5. how should i label the important pices of data are part of the problem

// --Explore concrete examples
// help understand the problem better
// provide sanity checks that solution works how it should

// --Break it down
// explicitly write down the steps


// --Simplify the problem
// write what you can and then later do the difficult part

// --Look Back and Refactor
// # questions
// Can you check results
// can you drive the result differnetly
// can you understand it a glance
// can you use the result or method for some other problem
// can you improve the performance of your solution
// can you think of other ways to refactor
// how have other people solved this problem
